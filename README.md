# Chic

A simple Interface for Chess written in Rust using [Slint](https://slint.rs/) for the user interface.

## About

This project is designed to visualize a chessboard. It is built as a beginner-level Rust project to explore GUI development concepts in **Rust** and practice coding with the Slint framework.
## Usage

1. Install Rust by following its [getting-started guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your `PATH`. Ensure that you have Rust installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running `cargo --version` and `rustc --version` in your terminal.
2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/cflaig/chess-ui) or download and extract the [ZIP archive of this repository](https://github.com/cflaig/chess-ui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. Change into the Project:
    ```
    cd chess-ui  
    ```
4. Build with `cargo`:
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
5. Run the application binary:
    ```
    cargo run
    ```
## Features
- üèÅ Display a chessboard based on a FEN string.
- ‚ú® Uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for piece images for a sharp and clean interface.
- üé® Dynamic and responsive UI layout using Slint for smooth experience.

Future plans include adding move generation, game state validation, and a simple engine.
## Next Steps

Here are some planned features for future iterations:
1. **Move Generation**: Add logic for generating legal moves based on the current board state.
2. **Basic Engine Support**: Integrate a simple chess engine for automated move suggestions.
3. **Database Features**:
   - Save/load games in a database.
   - Replay stored games directly via the graphical interface.

4. **User Interaction**: Allow users to make moves via the GUI to play against the engine or explore scenarios.
